      <h2 id="what-is-clojure">What is Clojure?</h2>

<p>Clojure is a LISP implementation with a simplified syntax and fantastic
concurrency support, targeting the Java Virtual Machine.</p>

<h2 id="who-me">Who, Me?</h2>

<p>Yes, you.</p>

<p>These pages were written for developers who have heard about Clojure, think it sounds
neat, but who are hitting a barrier to entry and would like a little more 
love.</p>

<p>Come here, give us a hug.  We were you and now we’re going to help.</p>

<h2 id="why-try-clojure">Why Try Clojure?</h2>

<p>Learning Clojure will make you a better software developer, provide you with an
elegant array of tools to solve interesting problems, and give you a leg up on
a language that’s only to get more popular and useful over time.</p>

<p>Too much? Okay, then.</p>

<p>Unless you’re already using a LISP or another
functional programming language, you’ll find that learning Clojure gives you
a few new approaches to understanding your craft. Clojure encourages and rewards 
you for following functional conventions.</p>

<p>Likewise, Clojure provides an opportunity to stretch out and get your noodle
around concurrency. It provides language features that let you get to the work
you need to do concurrently without hassling around with managing the
concurrency itself. Mostly.</p>

<p>Since Clojure runs on the JVM and plays well with Java, it’s a good candidate
for cleaning up crufty components quickly and transparently. You may find you
like doing the same work with much less code to maintain. Your boss may find
the cleaner code and swifter time to market nice as well.</p>

<p>Finally, we believe that Clojure has a bright future, and lives in a very sweet
spot. It works in the
enterprise, targeting an execution environment that’s widely deployed.
It works in the (growing) analytics space; lazy sequences allow the processing
of colossal data even in a relatively low-memory environment. It works on the
web, being ideal for creating web services. It even works in the browser, with
ClojureScript getting more mature with each passing week.</p>

<h2 id="now-with-apologies">Now With Apologies!</h2>

<p>Getting started with Clojure and its adjunct technologies can be difficult. The 
challenges of learning a new language, a new way of planning software, and
maybe even a new editor are daunting. Being a young language, changes are
common. Like most LISP communities, the Clojure community can be insular and
dismissive to outsiders.</p>

<p>Even given all of that, we think it’s worth learning, worth sharing, and we’ll
give you all the help we can to make your Clojure experience a pleasant one.</p>
